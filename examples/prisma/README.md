# REST API Example

This example shows how to implement a **REST API with TypeScript** using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Prisma Client](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/prisma-client-js/api.md). It is based on a SQLite database, you can find the database file with some dummy data at [`./prisma/dev.db`](./prisma/dev.db).

## How to use

### 1. Download example & install dependencies

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git --depth=1
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/typescript/rest-express
npm install
```

Note that this also generates Prisma Client JS into `node_modules/@prisma/client` via a `postinstall` hook of the `@prisma/client` package from your `package.json`.

### 2. Start the REST API server

Execute this command to start the server:

```
npm run dev
```

The server is now running on `http://localhost:3000`. You can send the API requests implemented in `index.js`, e.g. [`http://localhost:3000/feed`](http://localhost:3000/feed).

## Using the REST API

You can access the REST API of the server using the following endpoints:

### `GET`

- `/post/:id`: Fetch a single post by its `id`
- `/feed`: Fetch all _published_ posts
- `/filterPosts?searchString={searchString}`: Filter posts by `title` or `content`

### `POST`

- `/post`: Create a new post
  - Body:
    - `title: String` (required): The title of the post
    - `content: String` (optional): The content of the post
    - `authorEmail: String` (required): The email of the user that creates the post
- `/user`: Create a new user
  - Body:
    - `email: String` (required): The email address of the user
    - `name: String` (optional): The name of the user

### `PUT`

- `/publish/:id`: Publish a post by its `id`

### `DELETE`

- `/post/:id`: Delete a post by its `id`
